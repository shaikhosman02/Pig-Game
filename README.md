# Pig Game

Welcome to the Pig Game! This is a simple two-player game where players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points. The goal of the game is to reach a score of 100 points before your opponent does. Players can also choose to "hold" their current score to add it to their main score and pass the turn to the other player.
